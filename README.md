# 🕒 Beginner Project Assignment: Stopwatch App

## 🎯 Objective
Build a functional stopwatch application using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project will test your ability to structure a webpage, apply styling, and use JavaScript to add interactivity and logic.

## 📌 Project Requirements

### 1. HTML Structure
- Create a display area to show the elapsed time (e.g., `00:00:00`).
- Add three buttons:
  - **Start** → begins the timer.
  - **Stop** → pauses the timer.
  - **Reset** → sets the time back to zero.

### 2. CSS Styling
- Center the stopwatch on the page.
- Style the timer display so it looks like a digital clock.
- Style buttons with hover effects for better user experience.
- Use **Flexbox** or **Grid** for layout.

### 3. JavaScript Functionality
- The stopwatch should measure hours, minutes, and seconds.

**Start button**
- Begins counting time using `setInterval()`.
- Should not start multiple timers if clicked again.

**Stop button**
- Pauses the timer (`clearInterval()`).

**Reset button**
- Stops the timer and resets time to `00:00:00`.
